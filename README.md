# RepoAssist: AI-Powered Codebase Management Tool

RepoAssist is an AI-driven platform that connects with your Git repositories, leveraging the capabilities of Gemini 1.5, Langchain, and RAG to provide real-time insights and interactions with your codebase. Whether you're working solo or collaborating with a team, RepoAssist makes managing, querying, and understanding your codebase easier and more efficient.

## How It Works

RepoAssist seamlessly integrates with your GitHub repository to allow you to interact with your codebase using advanced AI models. By linking your repository, you can query your codebase, see your last 15 commits with summarized insights, and use speech-to-text AI to transcribe meetings and generate summaries.

### 1. **Load GitHub Repo Files using Langchain**
The repo files are treated as documents in Langchain.

### 2. **Use Gemini API to Summarize the Contents of Each Document**
Use `getSummary(document.pageContent)` for example, `bankers-algo.c`.  
This reduces the load on Gemini and ensures better embeddings.

Output:  
*This C code implements the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm. It simulates resource allocation among five processes (P0-P4) using three resource types. The algorithm checks if a safe sequence exists, meaning all processes can finish without deadlock. It uses allocation, maximum, and available resource matrices to determine if a safe sequence exists and prints the sequence if one is found; otherwise, it indicates that the system is unsafe (a deadlock could occur).*

### 3. **Vector Embed Each Summary and Store It in Vector Store**
Use `getEmbeddings(document.summary)` to generate vector embeddings like:  
`[0.345, 1.445, 0.455, 2.578]`

### 4. **Querying Data and Asking Questions**
Use `getEmbeddings(document.summary)` --> `queryVector`.  
The more similar the query vector is to different lines, the more similar they are. For example, `queryVector` and `service.ts` match the query, while `index.ts` doesn't match at all, showing they are at opposite directions.

### 5. **Retrieval Augmented Generation**

### 6. **Audio File Storage on Cloudinary and Text Conversion by AssemblyAI: Issues and Key Topics**
  a. The files are first uploaded to Cloudinary, which in return provides you with a URL.  
  b. Then, we create a meeting based on its defined schema.  
  c. After processing, the status is updated, and any issues generated for summaries are recorded.

## 4. **üìú Commit History Insights**
Review and summarize your last 15 commits with detailed notes, thanks to Gemini 1.5. Understand what was changed, why, and how it fits into your project without diving deep into the code manually. Cloudinary provides secure storage for any related media files, offering a comprehensive view of your project history.

## ‚ö° **Future Scope**

RepoAssist is a powerful AI-driven tool for efficient codebase management, and we‚Äôre excited about its future! Here are some key features and improvements we‚Äôre working on:

### 1. **GitHub API Rate Limit Management**
Currently, RepoAssist is constrained by GitHub's API rate limits, which may restrict the frequency and volume of interactions with large repositories or organizations. We are actively optimizing our API calls and exploring alternative methods to reduce dependency on GitHub's rate limits. This will improve performance and allow more seamless interactions with repositories.

### 2. **Advanced Query Optimization**
While RepoAssist provides real-time answers to questions, we plan to introduce advanced query optimizations that will better handle large codebases. Features like code context preservation across sessions will allow for even more accurate, detailed, and contextually aware responses.

### 3. **AI-Based Code Refactoring and Suggestions**
In future versions of RepoAssist, we plan to introduce AI-driven code refactoring suggestions. RepoAssist will not only answer questions but will also suggest code improvements, optimizations, and best practices, helping you maintain clean and efficient code.

### 4. **Support for Additional Repositories**
RepoAssist currently integrates with GitHub, but we plan to expand support for other version control platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket. This will make RepoAssist a more versatile tool for developers working across different ecosystems.

### 5. **Enhanced Meeting Insights and AI Summaries**
We‚Äôre continuously working on improving our meeting transcription and summarization feature. Upcoming enhancements include support for multi-speaker transcription, better summary accuracy, and automatic action item extraction. This will make it even easier to stay on top of key takeaways and next steps from meetings.

### 6. **Real-Time Collaboration**
We aim to introduce real-time collaboration, where teams can simultaneously query the codebase, share insights, and collaborate on solutions. This feature will enhance the dynamic nature of team workflows and improve collaboration within projects.

### 7. **Mobile App Support**
As part of our broader vision, we plan to develop a mobile app version of RepoAssist. This will allow users to interact with their repositories, query code, and access meeting summaries on the go, making RepoAssist even more accessible and useful.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance RepoAssist!
